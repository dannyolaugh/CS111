Lab 1a:

Known limitations: Because we have not yet implemented all of the options, we
are only able to run the --rdonly, --wronly, --command, and --verbose. Thus,
we cannot run any test cases that require pipes as we have not yet
implemented the --pipe command. This is the biggest limitation, as it narrows
down the utility value of our program and the test we are able to run on it.

Without other commands such as --wait it is impossible for us to implement
some of the ideas in the spec such as the exit statuses among other things.
